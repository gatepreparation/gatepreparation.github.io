        <h1>Motivation of Studying Fluid Mechanics</h1>

    There is a motivation to learn Fluid Mechanics. <br />
    Fluid Mechanics is almost everywhere. <br /><br />
    Applications include: <br />
    <div class="tab1">
        Automobiles (Standard Car, Sports) - designing the structure based on constraint like miniming drag or
        resistance. <br />
        Watercrafts - Analysis of flow patterns to mimimise resistance. <br />
        Spacecrafts - Most Fasciniting. Drag and Lift calculations. Includes Conservation of Momentum and Newton's
        Third Law of Motion. <br />
        Sport Ball Dynamics <br />
        Power and Process Plants - Study of Industrial flow patterns <br />
        Nature/inanimate - It is in nature - Tornado, River, Raindrop/Butterfly, Snake, Fish...) <br />
        Human body/ Medical Science (Respirartory, Pulmonary, cardiovascular systems, Sperm Swimming...) <br />
        <div class="tab1">
            It is mystery in fundamental science how diameter of blood vessel varies with local blood pressure.
        </div>
        Nuclear Explosion
        Fluid Structure Interation - There is interaction between fluid and structute and critical situation may occur
        like if impost frequencr matches natural frequency, resonance occurs and it may damage the structure.
        Food Drinks (Rheology)
        Not so fluid like Automobile Traffic
        Beautiful patterns... and more more not to traditional
    </div>
    <br /> <br /> <i>Fluid Mechanics is everywhere</i> <br /> <br />

    Modern fluid applications may iclude Cooling of Micro-Chips through Fluid Flow and Phase Change. As we haver to come to modern era, the sizes are getting smaller of devices, the power dissipation is not gettind reduced, so the power dissipation per unit volume is increasing and hence device heat up. We need to work on thermal device. <br />
    A compatible cooling ararangement is needed. We can involev strategy of change of phose. The liquid can take heat from hot spots and microchannel and when evaporated liquid moves to anither plce, we can condense it. This arrangement is known as heat-pipe. In minitiaturised form, we say it microheat pipe. <br />
    Another technology is droplet based microfluidics. The droplets sit on heat spots and absorb heat. It is very interesting to design the movement of droplets for optimal path and in shorted time they sit there and take away heat.<br />
    <i>Fluid Dynamics</i> is multidisciplinary and has applications in mechanical engineering, civil engineering,
    electrical engineering.<br />
    Health care engineering is an interface of healthcare with engineering. We require rapid diagnosis of diseases. A person is suspected to have certain disease. If he is not having access to high class pathology, So it takes long time for sophisticated tests. By the time the person undergoes through those processes, her/his state might be very critical. A workaround to make it better can be lab on a chip. Another alternative can be a device which is a rotating device called lab on a disc. We can have microchannels cut into the chip and we put a droplet of blood and then we spin the disc in small motor. Device is portable and this point of care approcah can be very useful. The blood is dropped into channel. Within the channel they are various reactants and reaction of blood with these can create some change like change of colour. A particular change of colour can give indication of diseseas. Fluid mechanics can be pivotalin design of shape, rotation, and flow of blood and other fluids etc. This proces can be completdd in small duration and can solve lot of health probelms in the world. <br />
    Another Process DNA Hybridization a proces of identification of a particular sequence of bases which can indicate the existence of certain disease. There are 4 different bases and particular sequence can help in diagnosis of disease. We can compliment of interroging sequence on wall of channel and pump a DNA smaple wit single strand, so first break the cell and the heat to craete single starnd and pass it through fluid flow, there is interation between fluid dynamics and transport and that helps in understand the getting hybrization and it helps in understanding hybridization and ultimately to rapid diagnosis of diseases. <br />
    Tracking the dynamics of biological cell is also an application of fluid mechanics. When the cells are moving through human body, moving across the blood vessels it has to move through microcapillaries, there is tremendous resistance through microcapillaries but cancer cells can survive through this micro confinement. Cell membrane composition is fluidic in nature, so the fluidity of the cell membrane has relation to malleability of cell and this manner in which cell membrane can control its malleability, base on that whether a cell can adapt to withastand and cancer cells survive. It is very impotant areas of research involving Fluid Dynamics. <br />
    Flow Physics can be combined with electricity and magneticism in electrohydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics and sometimes optics. Physics from multiple dynamics can join with Fluid Dynamics. For example we can change the path of water flow or move water using light. WE coat the surface of channel with metal oxide semiconductor and we shine UV light, because of typical energy gap, electron hole reaction starts and surface energy changes (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) and the movement of water happens.
